Rejoinderoo creates a rejoinder (response to reviewers) based on a CSV or Excel file.
The generated document is a LaTeX or Typst file that can be compiled to PDF.
An example of a generated rejoinder document is shown in [assets/example.pdf](./assets/example.pdf).

## Usage

![Demo usage of Rejoinderoo](./assets/demo.gif)

### Color coding of responses

The response boxes are color-coded based on the ID field,
which is the first selected field.
To determine different reviewers, the prefix of the ID field value is used until the first delimiter (`.`, `-`, or `:`).
E.g., `Rev1.3` becomes `Rev1` and `R1:3` becomes `R1`.

In the next step, a custom LaTeX color is created for each reviewer that can be adjusted.

`\colorlet{colorRev1}{blue!15!white}`
