(RQ1 = What are the guidelines, from white and gray literature, for source and test artifact review?) Basically, Table 3 should be at the level of detail provided by Table 4.""","The reviewer emphasized that the switch of Tables 3 and 4 would improve the paper, and we now see the benefits to the reading flow if the tables are switched.","- We have switched Tables 3 and 4. Now Section 4.2 includes the detailed table with all 33 guidelines to answer RQ1. Section 4.3 includes the overview table of nine guideline categories.
- We adjusted the wording in the ""Answer to RQ1/2"" boxes to ensure consistency with the switched tables.",Section 4.2; Section 4.3,done,Andreas
